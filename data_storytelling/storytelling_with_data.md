Notes on data storytelling while reading [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.

## 1 | The importance of context

### Exploratory analysis

Exploratory analysis differs completely from explanatory analysis. The latter is _not_ about telling everything you've learned. Rather, it is about effectively communicating **only** the information your audience needs to know. To make this easier, answer a few simple questions *before* crafting your story:

* Who is your audience (be specific)? What is their relationship to you? How can you best resonate with them?
* What do you want your audience to know or do? If recommending an action, make the call to action clear!
  * Once you identify this, make sure that **every** part of your story supports this goal and this goal only.
* How will you communicate?
  * If a live presentation, practice it to many friends and/or colleagues.
  * If a written document, have these same folks read, edit, and make comments. The more iterations the better.

Only *after* these questions have been answered should you start to think: **what data are available that will help make my point?**.
