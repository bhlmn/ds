Notes on data storytelling while reading [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.

## 1 | The importance of context

### Exploratory analysis

Exploratory analysis differs completely from explanatory analysis. The latter is _not_ about telling everything you've learned. Rather, it is about effectively communicating **only** the information your audience needs to know. To make this easier, answer a few simple questions *before* crafting your story:

* Who is your audience (be specific)? What is their relationship to you? How can you best resonate with them?
* What do you want your audience to know or do? If recommending an action, make the call to action clear!
  * Once you identify this, make sure that **every** part of your story supports this goal and this goal only.
* How will you communicate?
  * If a live presentation, practice it to many friends and/or colleagues.
  * If a written document, have these same folks read, edit, and make comments. The more iterations the better.

Only *after* these questions have been answered should you start to think: **what data are available that will help make my point?**

### The 3-minute story & Big Idea

You should be able to strip the "so-what" down to a paragraph or even *a single sentence*. The 3-minute story is self explanatory, and the author provides a great [example of one](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2014/02/the-3-minute-story). A 3-minute story contains the Big Idea, which is an even more concise version of your message.

The Big Idea must:
* articulate your unique point of view
* convey what's at stake
* be a complete sentence.

An example can be found [here](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2014/02/whats-big-idea). Identifying (and practicing) your 3-minute story and Big Idea ahead of item not only keeps your story focussed, it provides the ability to tell your story even if your allotted time gets cut in half on the spot!

### Storyboarding

[Storyboarding](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2015/8/24/how-i-storyboard) is the process of establishing a structure/visual outline of what you want to communicate. Grab a white-board or table, post-it notes, and/or a plain peice of paper. Write each point of your story on a separate post-it note ... than start organizing! Make sure to have your Big Idea on one of the post-its. It might belong at the end **and** the beginning!

## 2 | Choosing an effective visual

There are many types of visuals, but the author typically uses one of a select list ...

### Simple text

When you only have one or two numbers that you want to communicate, it can be very effective to just put up the number(s)! For example:
