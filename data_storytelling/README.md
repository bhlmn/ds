> "The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades."
> - Dr. Hal R. Varian, Chief Economist, Google (2009)

In describing this _skill_, Dr. Varian immediately breaks it down into five subskills:
* understand data
* process data
* extract value from data
* visualize data
* communicate data

This folder focusses on the last two: data visualization and communication. It contains a series of pages that collect my notes and thoughts on data storytelling and visualization.

## Data Storytelling

Data storytelling has been said to be [the essential skill every data scientist needs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#45860e2d52ad). It is a skill many data scientists and analysts struggle with, yet the demand for effective data storytelling is only increasing.

### Books

I'm currently reading [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/) and I highly recommend it. I'll put a concise summary here when I'm finished with it. I have a page of [working notes](https://github.com/bhlmn/ds/blob/master/data_storytelling/storytelling_with_data.md) I'm actively adding to as I read.

### Articles

* Jim Stikeleather, Harvard Business Review - [How to Tell a Story with Data](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data)

[Periscopic](http://www.periscopic.com/), a Portland-based data visualization firm, has put out dozens of articles that serve as impressive data storytelling examples (see the Examples section below). Fortunately they have also released some how-to articles that detail their data exploration and storytelling process:
* [Visualizing Spanish migration: A Case Study for Data Exploration at Periscopic](http://www.periscopic.com/news/visualizing-spanish-migration)
* [Behind the Scenes: Visualizing 264 Years of Swedish mortality](http://www.periscopic.com/news/visualizing-swedish-mortality)

### Examples

* Periscopic - [Emotions of the past ten U.S. presidential inaugural addresses](http://emotions.periscopic.com/inauguration/)
* Pudding - [What city is the microbrew capital of the US?](https://pudding.cool/2017/04/beer/)
* Pudding - [Are pop lyrics getting more repetetive?](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/)

## Data visualization

### Books

### Articles

Andy Kriebel's [Data Viz Done Right](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/) and [VizWiz](http://www.vizwiz.com/) are both excellent resources (both are focussed on Tableau). Data Viz Done Right highlights Data Visualization best practices by finding viz's from around the web and discussing what works (and what doesn't). VizWiz has some great initiatives (such as Workout Wednesday and Makeover Monday) where Andy finds a visualization that could be improved, issues a challenge to the public to improve it, then posts his improved version.
