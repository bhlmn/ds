> "The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades."
- Dr. Hal R. Varian, Chief Economist, Google (2009)

In describing this _skill_, Dr. Varian immediately breaks it down into five subskills:
* understand data
* process data
* extract value from data
* visualize data
* communicate data

This folder focusses on the last two: data visualization and communication. It contains a series of pages that collect my notes and thoughts on data storytelling and visualization.
