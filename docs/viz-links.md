## Scrollytelling

Scroll-driven data stories represent an interactive, state-of-the-art method for visualizing data. They are web-based, implemented with a plethora of [javascript libraries](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-implement-scrollytelling/).

#### Examples:

The Pudding's [craft beer story](https://pudding.cool/2017/04/beer/) is probably my favorite scroll-story of all time. Love the geography, interactivity, and interesting data.

#### Sources:

[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) is a weekly journal of visual essays. In my experience, they produce the most engaging, creative, and interesting data-driven stories. They also give (freely) their own [tips](https://pudding.cool/#pro-tips) for scrollytelling.
