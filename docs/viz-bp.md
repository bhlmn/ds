# Visualization Best Practices

These are largely inspired by [Andy Kriebel](http://www.datavizdoneright.com). They appear in no particular order (for now).

* Use grid lines, but make them light ([ex1](http://www.vizwiz.com/2017/10/gun-control.html)).
    * Always make sure they are behind data.
* Use title and subtitle(s) to capture attention and explain findings.
    * But don't repeat info! ([ex1](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/08/killings-of-blacks-by-whites.html))
* Use color choices that are relevant to the data ([ex1](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/upshot/killings-of-blacks-by-whites-are-far-more-likely-to-be-ruled-justifiable.html?smid=tw-share)).
* Keep the scale consistent across multiple charts ([ex1](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/08/london-pubs.html)).
* Include the data source and inspiration in the footer ([ex1](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/07/house-prices.html)).
* Include most recent values at end of time series ([ex1](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/05/french-election.html), [ex2](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/06/warriors-vs-cavs.html)).
    * Match to color of label to color of line ([ex1](http://www.datavizdoneright.com/2017/06/warriors-vs-cavs.html)).
    * Include categorical label (if necessary).
